### About

BrightnessMonitor is a Windows application (developed in C#) built to manually or automatically adjust your monitor's brightness. The following are features of the BrightnessMonitor application:
* Allows user to modify brightness on a scale from 1 to 100 (1 = Dimmest, 100 = Brightest).
* Allows user to set two preset brightnesses, based on time of day. I broke it up based on Day and Night, but it functions as two simple presets). These presets allow the user to select the time of change, brightness upon change, and the ability to gradually shift from the current brightness to the preset brightness (over a 90 second period making it easier on the eyes).
* Allows user to set the application as a startup application, setting your brightness on Windows boot.
* Allows user to keep application in the Windows tray, to prevent it from showing on your taskbar.
* Allows user to reset to defaults.

While not a "cyber security", I needed an application that would reduce eye strain on my bright monitors, with the option of automatically setting difference brightness values for day and night. I couldn't quite find one that did what I wanted and worked correctly, so I made this tool.
Let me know if you have feature requests.

Please note that while you do not need to install BrightnessMonitor, it requires the config file (which is in the current "Executable" directory). This file holds the values you set. Without this file, BrightnessMonitor will NOT start.
